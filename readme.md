## Architecture

This project focuses on building a scalable, serverless SIEM solution on AWS, leveraging CloudWatch Agents, Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, SNS, OpenSearch, and Elastic Load Balancing. 

#### AWS Architecture Diagram

<br>

<p align="center">
<a target="_blank" href=""></a><img src="https://github.com/issambenhida/sageowl/blob/main/assets/images/image02.svg?raw=true" height="95%" width="95%" alt="">
</p>

<br>

The platform is designed to provide real-time log analysis, threat detection, and high availability to ensure a robust and efficient security monitoring system.

#### Disaster Recovery Plan
Sage owl project employs a cost-effective **backup and restore** strategy as part of its disaster recovery plan.

+ **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:
This project established clear recovery goals
  to ensure robust data protection and quick recovery from potential disruptions.
  The RPO is calculated between **10 and 15 minutes** allowing for minimal data loss in the event of a failure.
+ **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**:
Simultaneously, the RTO is calculated between **15 and 30 minutes**, ensuring that the system can be restored and operational within this timeframe.

</p>

> [!TIP]
> Different data sets may have varying levels of criticality, and tailoring the Recovery Point Objective and Recovery Time Objective to reflect this can enhance the overall effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan.

## Environments
This project is structured into three distinct environments: **development**, **staging**, and **production**. Each environment is configured to support specific stages of the development lifecycle, allowing for efficient testing and deployment processes while ensuring that changes can be validated before reaching the production stage.

#### Development
In the development environment, we leverage <a href="https://www.localstack.cloud/">LocalStack</a> to simulate AWS services, providing a risk-free testing environment at no cost :moneybag:.

<a target="_blank" href=""></a><img src="https://github.com/IssamBenhida/sageowl/blob/main/assets/images/image01.svg?raw=true" height="95%" width="95%" alt="">
</p>

<br>

It is also possible to ensure the smooth integration and maintenance of local AWS services by using **tflocal** for Terraform resource deployment and **awslocal** for LocalStack interaction.

LocalStack dashboard is a great option as well.

</p>

<br>

This should also make our testing process much faster, easier and risk-free.

#### Staging

## CI/CD With Jenkins

The Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Sage Owl project automates the build, testing, and deployment processes
for the three environments to ensure code quality and accelerate delivery.

#### Development
